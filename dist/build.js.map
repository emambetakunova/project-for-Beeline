Текст настоящего Соглашения является публичной офертой и прохождение процедуры идентификации\n        является принятием оферты, то есть полным и безоговорочным согласием пользователя с условиями настоящего\n        Соглашения.\n      <p> 1. Доступ к Услуге </p>\n      <p> 1.1. Для получения доступа к Сети, Пользователю необходимо подключить своё пользовательское (оконечное)\n        оборудование к Wi-Fi сети Beeline.\n      <p> 1.2. После выбора сети появляется окно авторизации, где Пользователю необходимо ввести свои данные *:\n      <p> 1.2.1. Номер телефона Beeline;\n      <p> 1.2.2. Ознакомиться с условиями настоящего Соглашения и принять их, поставив галочку;\n        В случае отказа от условий Соглашения, использование Wi-Fi сети Beeline будет невозможным.\n      <p> 1.2.3. Нажать на кнопку «Получить код». Ввести код, полученный посредством SMS-сообщения в поле «Введите код».\n        Далее нажать кнопку «Подключиться»;\n      <p> 1.2.4. В случае успешной авторизации, Пользователю будет показано соответствующее сообщение и предоставлен\n        доступ к Wi-Fi сети Beeline. В случае неудачной авторизации, Пользователю будет показано сообщение об ошибке,\n        возможные причины и способы решения;\n      <p> 1.3. Доступ к Услуге предоставляется без ограничений по времени и объёму трафика.\n      <p> 2. Описание Услуги\n      <p> 2.1. Услуга обеспечивает Пользователям доступ к сети Интернет посредством использования сети беспроводного\n        доступа (далее – «Услуга»). Услуга предоставляется только при нахождении Пользователя в зоне уверенного приёма\n        радиосигнала точки доступа Wi-Fi сети Beeline.\n      <p> 2.2. Услуга предоставляется Пользователям на условиях настоящего Соглашения.\n      <p> 2.3. Доступ к Услуге возможен с использованием мобильных телефонов, планшетных персональных компьютеров,\n        ноутбуков и иного оборудования, поддерживающего подключение к сети по технологии Wi-Fi. Настройка\n        пользовательского (оконечного) оборудования для пользования Услугами производится Пользователем самостоятельно.\n      <p> 2.4. Услуга предоставляется без ограничений по времени, за исключением проведения необходимых профилактических\n        и ремонтных работ.\n      <p> 2.5. Услуга может предоставляться на частотах 2,4 GHz, 5 GHz. Предоставление услуги в конкретном месте зависит\n        от технической возможности Оператора, а также, от технических возможностей пользовательского (оконечного)\n        оборудования.\n      <p> 2.6. Услуга предоставляется на максимальной скорости 100 Мбит/сек. Исходя из степени интенсивности\n        использования сетевых ресурсов и объёма одновременно пропускаемого трафика всех Пользователей, подключённых к\n        одной точке доступа скорость может меняться. Оператор не гарантирует скорость обмена информацией между\n        пользовательским (оконечным) оборудованием и сетью связи Оператора и бесперебойность доступа к Услуге.\n      <p> 2.7. С помощью одного и того же номера мобильного телефона можно авторизовать одно пользовательское\n        (оконечное) устройство.\n      <p> 2.8. При использовании Услуги, пользовательскому (оконечному) оборудованию присваиваются динамические\n        приватные IP-адреса.\n      <p> 2.9. Услуга предоставляется «как есть» («as is») и в том виде, в котором она доступна на момент\n        предоставления, при этом никаких гарантий, прямых или косвенных, по скорости обмена информацией, бесперебойности\n        доступа к Услуге и других, Пользователям не предоставляется.\n      <p> 2.10.
